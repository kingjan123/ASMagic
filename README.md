**Before you do anything else, open config.py (in a text editor or nano) and make the following changes:**

> • Set `token` to the authentication token that you received from [`@BotFather`](http://telegram.me/BotFather).
>
> • Insert your numerical Telegram ID into the `sudos` table. Other superadmins can be added too. It is important that you insert the numerical ID and NOT a string.
>

## Some notes about the database

*Everything* is stored on Redis, and the fastest way to edit your database is via the [Redis CLI](http://redis.io/topics/rediscli).

You can find a backup of your Redis database in `/etc/redis/dump.rdb`. The name of this file and the frequency of saves are dependent on your redis configuration file.
